## 🧠 Problem We're Solving

In South Africa, around _67% of the population_ lives in _townships and rural areas, where access to financial services is limited. Residents often travel long distances just to use an ATM for \*\*basic tasks_ like deposits, withdrawals, or payments. Meanwhile, _small informal businesses_ (e.g. taxis, vendors, buskers) still rely on cash, making transactions _slow, unsafe, and inconvenient_.

---

## 💡 Our Unique Solution

We are solving this problem by:

- _Transforming local spaza shops_ into _wallet service hubs_ for digital deposits, withdrawals, and payments.
- Using the _Interledger Protocol (ILP)_ to ensure seamless, low-cost transactions across different networks.
- Enabling digital payments to _informal vendors_, reducing dependency on cash and increasing financial security.
- Leveraging _community trust and existing infrastructure_ to scale adoption quickly and affordably.

## ✅ Why iLulaMoney is Different

- 🏪 _Community-first_: Builds on trusted spaza shops already embedded in local communities.
- 💸 _Cashless for the informal sector_: Enables digital payments for micro-entrepreneurs and unbanked users.
- 🔗 _Interoperable and low-cost_: Powered by ILP to work across providers with minimal transaction fees.
- 🔐 _Secure and scalable_: Makes payments safer while preparing communities for digital financial inclusion.

## 🚀 Conclusion
